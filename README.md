# group9_2020_project
Project done during the Data Science course during my master degree at Lausanne University

There is no secret to be successful, you need money to be able to build a competitive team or just to keep your best players.

The aim of the project is to understand the impact of the market value on the final ranking by first doing some EDA and then building a model, assess the goodness of fit and see if we can predict some good results.
